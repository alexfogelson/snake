# Snake Game+
## Who would spend time doing this?
Well, me, clearly. But first, some background.

## What this has to do with Pacman...
In an interview with Lex Fridman, machine learning and artificial intelligence researcher Charles Isbell from Georgia Tech
cautions programming novices not to dip their feet in the coding deep end. He says endevouring to accomplish something great programmatically before
learning the basics will almost surely lead to frustration, and eventually giving up. But after years of perfecting the skill, Isbell sat down to write Pacman
in a day, with the hopes that it would be trivial after all this time. Indeed it was.

## An afternoon
Graphics isn't exactly my specialty. But Snake is an easy enough game to display (everythinig is cut into bi(y)te sized pieces) that it seemed fitting to set this
as my goal. Consider this the equivalent of an English major taking the SAT for fun. Surely difficult for someone who's never seen an if statement, but hopefully easy enough
for someone with a bit of experience under their belt. So this is what I came up with...

## A twist

This snake gets really hungry. Every so often, eating food will make it multiply!
